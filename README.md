# CIS-4360-Projects
A collection of my projects from the course Computational Methods in Finance (CIS 4360) with professor Alex Pang at Temple University. Dr. Pang gave permission for me to show off my solutions to these projects. These projects perform various analyses on stocks based on an SQL databse generated by the script Fetcher.py that can be found in the Technical Analysis project.
