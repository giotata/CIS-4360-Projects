# Black-Scholes Options Pricer
The goal of this project was to implement the Black-Scholes Model. In particular, I implemented a model class to calculate the fair value of a call and put option. I also implemented the put-call parity and functions to calculate all the greeks of a option. Code templates were provided by professor Pang to get us started.
